    "The k-means algorithm separates data into k equal-variance groups minimizing the sum-of-squares distance of their samples to their respective centroids.  It does so by first choosing k arbitrary data points as centroids and then assigning each point to its nearest centroid, whereafter the algorithm calculates a new set of centroids by averaging the positions of the samples assigned to each.  k-means clustering repeats this process with the new centroids until they move less than some tolerance.\n",

    "While this method always converges over enough time, it may do so only to a local minimum, and whether it does or not greatly depends on the choice of initial centroids.  Therefore, it is often repeated over some number of initial centroid sets. The k-means clustering algorithm in scikit-learn includes a k-means++ initialization method ensuring that initial centroids are distant."
